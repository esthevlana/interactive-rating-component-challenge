## Overview

Amazing challenge to train responsive design and DOM manipulation.

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

For me this second Frontend Mentor challenge was a bit more complex than the QR code component challenge not only because it had more elements to be manipulated through CSS, but also because of the DOM manipulation, which I definitely haven't mastered yet. But thanks to youtube I was able to access several examples of similar uses. ðŸ™Œ

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me understand a little more about both CSS (responsive design - still not perfect!!) and DOM manipulation.

### Continued development

This challenge made me realize that, compared to a few weeks ago, I have managed to improve my CSS skills. But at the same time it made me realize how much I need to dedicate myself to evolve my javascript knowledge. ðŸ¤“
